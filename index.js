/* 4) Define a function with one parameter, which will be a string. The function must do the following:
a) Have a clear, descriptive name.
b) Retrieve only the last character from strings with lengths of 3 or less.
3 or less - subtract the last character of the string
c) Retrieve only the first 3 characters from strings with lengths larger than 3. 
More than 3 - subtract the first 3 characters of the string

d) Use a template literal to return the phrase, "We put the '___' in '___'." Fill the first blank with the modified string, and fill the second blank



function newString(string){
  if (string > string.length || string < string.length){
    .slice()
  }
}

console.log(`We put the ${}' in ${}." `);//Fill the first blank with the modified string, and fill the second blank with the original string.

/* Now test your function:
e) Outside of the function, define the variable str and initialize it with a string (e.g. 'Functions rock!').
